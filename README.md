Eye-Fi server for DiskStation
===

Eye-Fi server for DiskStation. Geotagging with xmp file supported.

If you are a DiskStation user, it would be great if your camera will upload all its photo to your DiskStation when the camera is the same local WiFi network.

This is a pure python implementation of Eye-Fi server. DiskStation has a linux with very limited libraries built in. It's also hard to compile most things on it. With  pure python implementation, it works on my DS413 with a powerpc CPU.

CONFIG
---
Config file is at `./eyefi/config.py`

To use this script you need to have your Eye-Fi upload key. You can find it after configuring the card, which you can currently on do on windows or mac. `C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Eye-Fi\Settings.xml on windows` or `~/Applications Data/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml` on mac

    data["upload_key"] = "YOUR_KEY"

All files are downloaded in one directory

    data["upload_dir"] = "/tmp/eyefifolder"
    data["upload_subdir"] = "/%Y/%Y-%m-%d"

Get you own geolocation API key from [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/geolocation/). **If no key is given, an undocumented Google API will be used instead.**

    data["google_geo_key"] = ""

This is where your log file is saved

    data["log_file"] = "/tmp/eyefi.log"
